##1. Load libraries

```{r, message=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidylog)
library(lme4)
library(lmerTest)
library(stats)
library(rptR)
```


##2. Load data

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
shell <- read.csv( "Thickness Dataset (for RMarkdown).csv", na.strings = "", as.is=T)

```

There are a couple of eggs that have high elongation (length to width ratios), indicating that they are unusually shaped. We will preform the analysis with and without them. "shell"  dataset is the full dataset, including the runts, shell2 has 4 runts removed. Interestingly enough, they are all from a single nest (PE24). Perhaps there is something wrong with the female. 

```{r}
#Calculate elongation
shell$Elongation <- shell$Length_egg/shell$Width_egg
hist(shell$Elongation)

shell2  <- shell %>% filter(Elongation >1.1)
```


##3. Check to make sure that we don't need to control for relationships between eggshell thickness and year, treatment, or egg age. 
###3.1 Testing for year effects

```{r}
mod_year <- lmer(Thickness_shell~factor(Year)+ (1|NestID), data=shell)
plot(mod_year)
summary(mod_year)
anova(mod_year)
```
No difference in thickness based on year. 

Redo without including oddlyshaped eggs. 
```{r}
#re-do without oddly shaped eggs
mod_year2 <- lmer(Thickness_shell~factor(Year)+ (1|NestID), data=shell2)
plot(mod_year2)
summary(mod_year2)
anova(mod_year2)

```
Conclusions: there is no significant relationship between year and eggshell thickness, so we do not need to control for year in future analyses. This is the case whether or not we include PE24 eggs (oddly shaped). 

###3.2 Testing for treatment effects
```{r}
mod_treatment <- lmer(Thickness_shell~Treatment + (1|NestID), data=shell)
plot(mod_treatment)
summary(mod_treatment)
anova(mod_treatment)

#re-do without oddly shaped eggs
mod_treatment2 <- lmer(Thickness_shell~Treatment + (1|NestID), data=shell2)
plot(mod_treatment2)
summary(mod_treatment2)
anova(mod_treatment2)

```
Conclusions: there is no significant relationship between treatment and eggshell thickness, so we do not need to control for egg age in future analyses. This is the case whether or not we include PE24 eggs (oddly shaped). 

###3.3 Testing for effects of egg age
```{r}
mod_incstage <- lmer(Thickness_shell~EggAge + (1|NestID), data=shell)
plot(mod_incstage)
summary(mod_incstage)
anova(mod_incstage)

#re-do without oddly shaped eggs
mod_incstage2 <- lmer(Thickness_shell~EggAge + (1|NestID), data=shell2)
plot(mod_incstage2)
summary(mod_incstage2)
anova(mod_incstage2)
```
Conclusions: there is no significant relationship between egg age and eggshell thickness, so we do not need to control for egg age in future analyses of eggshell thickness, regardless of whether PE24 eggs are included. 



##4. Does eggshell thickness correlate with egg volume or egg length, as physics suggests it should? 

###4.1 Egg Volume
```{r}
mod_volume <- lmer(Thickness_shell~Volume_egg + (1|NestID), data=shell) 
plot(mod_volume)
summary(mod_volume)
anova(mod_volume)
```
Larger eggs by volume are thicker. 
Confirm that is not due to funny shaped PE24 eggs
```{r}
mod_volume2 <- lmer(Thickness_shell~Volume_egg + (1|NestID), data=shell2) 
plot(mod_volume2)
summary(mod_volume2)
anova(mod_volume2)


plot(resid(mod_volume2)~shell2$Volume_egg) #looks fine
```
Relationship holds, with and without the funny shaped PE24 eggs. However there is an outlier. Confirm that this relationship holds, even when outliers are removed

```{r}
#Remove the outlier (shown in red in the below plot)
shell_v <- shell %>% filter(Thickness_shell<0.14 | Volume_egg>6 )
#Remove the outlier from the shell2 dataset as well
shell2_v <- shell2 %>% filter(Thickness_shell<0.14 | Volume_egg>6 )

#Without outlier
mod_volume3 <- lmer(Thickness_shell~Volume_egg + (1|NestID), data=shell_v) 
plot(mod_volume3)
summary(mod_volume3)
anova(mod_volume3)

#Without outlier or weirdly shaped eggs
mod_volume4 <- lmer(Thickness_shell~Volume_egg + (1|NestID), data=shell2_v) 
plot(mod_volume4)
summary(mod_volume4)
anova(mod_volume4)

ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=shell, aes(y=Thickness_shell, x=Volume_egg), shape=1)+ #add all points
  geom_point(data=shell %>% filter(Thickness_shell>0.14 & Volume_egg<6), aes(y=Thickness_shell, x=Volume_egg), color="red")+ # plot outlier point in red
  geom_smooth(data=shell, aes(y=Thickness_shell, x=Volume_egg), method="lm", color="red")+ #make trend line, including the outlier
    geom_smooth(data=shell_v, aes(y=Thickness_shell, x=Volume_egg), method="lm", color="black")+ #make trendsline, excluding the outlier
  labs(x="Volume (ml)", y="Eggshell thickness (mm)" )+
  theme_classic()

```

Conclusion: Yes, larger eggs (by volume) have thicker shells. Relationship is stronger when the outlier and PE24 (weird shape) egg are removed.  High quality eggs are likely larger so this relationship could indicate that higher quatlity eggs are also thicker. Physics suggests larger eggs should be thicker, so we should probably control for this in other analyses. 

###4.2 Egg Length
Egg length is arguabley a more important measurement than volume in terms of eggshell strench. Longer eggs are more breakable so could be assumed to be more likely to be thicker, if it's about the shear physics of the matter. 

```{r}
mod_length <- lmer(Thickness_shell ~ Length_egg + (1|NestID), data=shell)
plot(mod_length)
summary(mod_length)
anova(mod_length)
```

There are some major outliers here, so we have removed all eggs with length less that 2.6 from "shell3" and whenever we do length data we will try using that dataset as well. We loose 8 abnormally short eggs. 
```{r}
hist(shell$Length_egg)
shell3 <- shell %>% filter(Length_egg>2.6)
hist(shell3$Length_egg)



mod_length2 <- lmer(Thickness_shell ~ Length_egg + (1|NestID), data=shell3)
plot(mod_length2)
summary(mod_length2)
anova(mod_length2)


ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=shell, aes(x=Length_egg, y=Thickness_shell))+
  geom_point(data=shell %>% filter(Length_egg<2.6), aes(x=Length_egg, y=Thickness_shell), color="red")+
  geom_smooth(data=shell, aes(x=Length_egg, y=Thickness_shell), method="lm", color="red")+
  geom_smooth(data=shell3, aes(x=Length_egg, y=Thickness_shell), color="black", method="lm")

```
There are some pretty strong outliers in shell length. Excluding those outliers shows that as shell length increases, so does shell thickness. Since volume is calculated using length, we know that length will be correlated with volume. I will use Length in all future analyses to control for the physics. Similarly, we will exclude all unusually small eggs. 


##5. Does eggshell thickness correlate with any clutch traits (clutch size, clutch initiation date, laying order)?
###5.1 Clutch Size (comparing 3 and 4 egg clutches only)
Controlling for length
```{r}
mod_clutch <-lmer(Thickness_shell ~ factor(ClutchSize) + Length_egg + (1|NestID), data=shell3 %>% filter(ClutchSize %in% c(3,4)))   #Filtered out clutches that weren't 3 or 4 eggs
plot(mod_clutch)
summary(mod_clutch)
anova(mod_clutch) 
```
No relationship between clutch size (3 vs 4) and eggshell thickness when controlling for egg length. 


Controlling for volume
```{r}
mod_clutch <- lmer(Thickness_shell ~ factor(ClutchSize) + Volume_egg + (1|NestID), data=shell %>% filter(ClutchSize %in% c(3,4)))   #Filtered out clutches that weren't 3 or 4 eggs
plot(mod_clutch)
summary(mod_clutch)
anova(mod_clutch)

#without the PE24 weird shaped eggs
mod_clutch <- lmer(Thickness_shell ~ factor(ClutchSize) + Volume_egg + (1|NestID), data=shell2 %>% filter(ClutchSize %in% c(3,4)))   #Filtered out clutches that weren't 3 or 4 eggs


```
Conclusion: Eggshell thickness is not associated with clutch size. However, this may be due to the fact that American robins have very little variation in clutch size, almost always laying 3-4 eggs. 

###5.2 Clutch Initiation Date
Controlling for egg length
```{r}
mod_date <- lmer(Thickness_shell ~ ClutchInitiationDate + Length_egg + (1|NestID), data=shell3) 
plot(mod_date)
summary(mod_date)
anova(mod_date)
```
When controlling for egg length, there is not relationship between clutch initiation date and eggshell thickness. 

Controlling for egg volume
```{r}
mod_date <- lmer(Thickness_shell ~ ClutchInitiationDate + Volume_egg + (1|NestID), data=shell) 
plot(mod_date)
summary(mod_date)
anova(mod_date)
```
Conclusion: Eggshell thickness is not associated with clutch initiation date. 

###5.3 Laying Order
Controlling for egg length
```{r}
mod_order <- lmer(Thickness_shell ~ LayOrder_est + Length_egg + (1|NestID), data=shell3)
#WARNING WARNING
#will not converge, probably because no variance in random effect. 
plot(mod_order)
summary(mod_order)
anova(mod_order)
```

Controlling for volume
```{r}
mod_order <- lmer(Thickness_shell ~ LayOrder_est + Volume_egg + (1|NestID), data=shell)
plot(mod_order)

summary(mod_order)
anova(mod_order)
```
Conclusion: Eggshell thickness is not associated with laying order.



##6. Does eggshell thickness correlate with any female quality indices (age, body condition, ectoparasite load, proportion of yellow on the bill)?
###6.1 Female Age

Controlling for egg length
```{r}
mod_femage <- lmer(Thickness_shell ~ factor(FemaleAge) + Length_egg+ (1|NestID), data=shell3) 
plot(mod_femage)
summary(mod_femage)
anova(mod_femage)
```
No indication that female age is associated with eggshell thickness when controlling for length of egg. 

Controlling for egg volume
```{r}
mod_femage <- lmer(Thickness_shell ~ factor(FemaleAge) + Volume_egg+ (1|NestID), data=shell) 
plot(mod_femage)
summary(mod_femage)
anova(mod_femage)

mod_femage <- lmer(Thickness_shell ~ factor(FemaleAge) + Volume_egg+ (1|NestID), data=shell2) 

```
Conclusion: Eggshell thickness is not associated with female age.

###6.2 Female body condition
Controlling for egg length
```{r}
mod_femcondition <- lmer(Thickness_shell ~ ScaledBodyMass_female+ Length_egg+ (1|NestID), data=shell3) 
plot(mod_femcondition)
summary(mod_femcondition)
anova(mod_femcondition)
```
No indication that body condition is correlated with eggshell thickness when controlling for length. 

Controlling for egg volume
```{r}
mod_femcondition <- lmer(Thickness_shell ~ ScaledBodyMass_female+ Volume_egg+ (1|NestID), data=shell) 
plot(mod_femcondition)
summary(mod_femcondition)
anova(mod_femcondition)

mod_femcondition <- lmer(Thickness_shell ~ ScaledBodyMass_female+ Volume_egg+ (1|NestID), data=shell2) 


ggplot(shell, aes(color=ScaledBodyMass_female, y=Thickness_shell, x=Volume_egg))+
         geom_point()+
  labs(x="SMI", y="Residual Eggshell Thickness (mm/ml)")


```
Conclusion: Eggshell thickness is not associated with female scaled body mass. Relationship not influence by PE24 weird shaped eggs. 

###6.3 Female Ectoparasite Load
Controlling for length rather than volume, using proper length dataset that has removed unusually small eggs
```{r}
mod_ecto <- lmer(Thickness_shell ~ Ectoparasites2+ Length_egg+(1|NestID), data=shell3)
plot(mod_ecto)
qqnorm(resid(mod_ecto))
summary(mod_ecto)
anova(mod_ecto)


ggplot(shell3 %>% filter(!is.na(Ectoparasites2)), aes(x=Length_egg, y=Thickness_shell, color=Ectoparasites2))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method="lm")
```
If a female has NO parasites, she is tends to lay thicker eggs. The effect of length is now marginally significant. 


We could also use a fixed effect for nest. I think that would be a silly thing to do though. We haven't got more than 4 observations for almost all nests, but there are a whole lot of nests so this really eats up df. 4 observations per groups isn't ideal for actually calculating means and se for each group either. 
```{r}
lmod_ecto <- lm(Thickness_shell ~ Ectoparasites2+ Length_egg +NestID, data=shell3)
plot(lmod_ecto)
summary(lmod_ecto)
```

Controlling for volume 
```{r}
mod_ecto <- lmer(Thickness_shell ~ Ectoparasites2+ Volume_egg +(1|NestID), data=shell)
plot(mod_ecto)
qqnorm(resid(mod_ecto))
summary(mod_ecto)
anova(mod_ecto)



mod_ecto <-lm(Thickness_shell ~ Ectoparasites2+ Volume_egg + NestID, data=shell2)
plot(mod_ecto)
qqnorm(resid(mod_ecto))
summary(mod_ecto)
anova(mod_ecto)

```
Conclusion: There is a small effect of ectoparasites on eggshell thickness.  


###6.4 Propotion of yellow on female bill
Controlling for egg length
```{r}
mod_bill <- lmer(Thickness_shell ~ YellowAreaScore_female + Length_egg + (1|NestID) , data=shell3)
plot(mod_bill)
summary(mod_bill)
anova(mod_bill)
```



Controlling for egg volume
```{r}
mod_bill <- lmer(Thickness_shell ~ YellowAreaScore_female + Volume_egg + (1|NestID) , data=shell)
plot(mod_bill)
summary(mod_bill)
anova(mod_bill)

mod_bill <- lmer(Thickness_shell ~ YellowAreaScore_female + Volume_egg + (1|NestID) , data=shell2)


ggplot(shell, aes(x=YellowAreaScore_female, y=Thickness_shell))+
  geom_count()+
  geom_smooth(method="lm")+
  labs(x="Female Bill Yellowness", y="Shell Thickness (mm)")
```


Conclusion: There is no significant relationship between the amount of yellow on the female's bill and the eggshell thickness, when we control for egg volume or length. 

##7. Does eggshell thickness correlate with any egg quality indices (volume, yolk mass, albumen mass, color, yolk testosterone concentration, total yolk carotenoids)?


###7.1 Yolk Mass

There are a couple of eggs with very high Yolk Masses. Looking at those eggs, they also have low albumen masses which suggests to me that when the two parts of the egg were being sperated they probably got some albumen in the yolk. I will include and exclude those eggs. 

Controlling for egg length
```{r}
mod_yolk <- lmer(Thickness_shell ~ Mass_yolk + Length_egg + (1|NestID), data=shell3)
plot(mod_yolk)
summary(mod_yolk)
anova(mod_yolk)



#same again, but this time removing the suspiciously high yolk masses. 
mod_yolk <- lmer(Thickness_shell ~ Mass_yolk + Length_egg + (1|NestID), data=shell3 %>% filter(Mass_yolk<2))
plot(mod_yolk)
summary(mod_yolk)
anova(mod_yolk)

```
Either way, when controlling for egg length, there is no relationship between yolk mass and eggshell thickness. 


Controlling for egg volume
```{r}
#Including everything
mod_yolk <- lmer(Thickness_shell~ Mass_yolk + Volume_egg  + (1|NestID), data=shell) 

plot(mod_yolk)
summary(mod_yolk)
anova(mod_yolk)


#Excluding the high yolk masses. 

mod_yolk <- lmer(Thickness_shell~ Mass_yolk + Volume_egg  + (1|NestID), data=shell %>% filter(Mass_yolk <2))


#Excluding the high yolk masses and PE24
mod_yolk <- lmer(Thickness_shell~ Mass_yolk + Volume_egg  + (1|NestID), data=shell2 %>% filter(Mass_yolk <2))



ggplot(shell, aes(y=Thickness_shell, x=Mass_yolk ))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method="lm")


```
Conclusions: Yolk mass not related to shell thickness, whether you include the suspiciously high masses or PE24 or not. 

###7.2  Albumen Mass
Controlling for egg length
```{r}
mod_alb <- lmer(Thickness_shell ~Mass_albumen + Length_egg + (1|NestID), data=shell3)
plot(mod_alb)
summary(mod_alb)
anova(mod_alb)
```
When you control for egg length, no significant relationship between eggshell thickness and albumen mass. Does make egg length no longer sig.  

Controlling for egg volume
```{r}
mod_alb <- lmer(Thickness_shell~Mass_albumen + Volume_egg + (1|NestID), data=shell)
plot(mod_alb)
summary(mod_alb)
anova(mod_alb)


mod_alb <- lmer(Thickness_shell~Mass_albumen + Volume_egg + (1|NestID), data=shell2)
plot(mod_alb)
summary(mod_alb)
anova(mod_alb)

```
Conclusion: Albumen mass is not associated with eggshell thickness, whether or not PE24 is included.

###7.3 Egg Color using PCA

First calculate a color PCA
```{r}
PCA_color <- prcomp( shell[,c(37:39, 41:42)], 
               center=T, 
               scale=T, 
               retx=T)
summary(PCA_color) #PC1 is sufficient
shell$PC1 <- predict(PCA_color)[,1]
```
Color is adequately decribed by a single PC axis. 
now we have to re-filter shell2 and shell3 so PC1 is in there.
```{r}
shell2  <- shell %>% filter(Elongation >1.1)
shell3 <- shell %>% filter(Length_egg>2.6)
```

```{r}
mod_colorpc1 <- lmer(Thickness_shell ~ PC1 + Length_egg + (1|NestID), data=shell3) 
plot(mod_colorpc1)
anova(mod_colorpc1)
summary(mod_colorpc1)


mod_colorpc <- lmer(Thickness_shell ~ PC1 + Volume_egg + (1|NestID), data=shell2) 

```
When you control for egg length, color is not associated with shell thickness. 

```{r}
mod_colorpc <- lmer(Thickness_shell ~ PC1 + Volume_egg + (1|NestID), data=shell) 
plot(mod_colorpc)
anova(mod_colorpc)
summary(mod_colorpc)


mod_colorpc <- lmer(Thickness_shell ~ PC1 + Volume_egg + (1|NestID), data=shell2) 

```
Conclusion: Egg color is not associated with eggshell thickness when we control for volume. 

###7.4 Yolk Testosterone Concentration
There are some pretty high T values, that we will probably need to remove, but we will start with them in, just controlling for length. 

```{r}
mod_T <- lmer(Thickness_shell ~ T_concentration + Length_egg  +(1|NestID), data=shell3) 
plot(mod_T)
summary(mod_T)
anova(mod_T)

```
Significant relationship between T and eggshell thickness, but is that driven by the high values? 

```{r}
mod_T2 <- lmer(Thickness_shell ~ T_concentration + Length_egg  +(1|NestID), data=shell3 %>% filter(T_concentration<12)) 
plot(mod_T2) #that's more reasonable
summary(mod_T2)
anova(mod_T2)
```
The relationship is now no longer significant, but still present. 


Now repeat the analysis, controlling for volume instead of length. 
```{r}
mod_T <- lmer(Thickness_shell ~ T_concentration + Volume_egg  +(1|NestID), data=shell) 
plot(mod_T)
summary(mod_T)
anova(mod_T)


mod_T <- lmer(Thickness_shell ~ T_concentration + Volume_egg  +(1|NestID), data=shell %>% filter(T_concentration<12))
plot(mod_T)
summary(mod_T)
anova(mod_T)

#If we exclude outliers and weird PE24 eggs
mod_T <- lmer(Thickness_shell ~ T_concentration + Volume_egg  +(1|NestID), data=shell2 %>% filter(T_concentration<12))


ggplot(shell, aes(x=T_concentration, y=Thickness_shell))+
  geom_point(shape=1)+
  geom_smooth(method="lm", color="red")+ #Including outliers
  geom_smooth(data=shell %>% filter(T_concentration<12), method="lm", color="black")+ #Not including outliers
  theme_classic()+
  labs(x="Yolk testosterone COncentration (ug/)", y="Eggshell thickness (mm)")

```
Conclusion: Higher Yolk testosterone correlates with thicker eggs. However, there are a couple of eggs where yolk testerone is extremely high. Excluding those points, there is still a relationship, but it is not longer significant. Excluding PE24 points as well does not change result. 


###7.5 Total Yolk Carotenoids 

If we control for egg length
```{r}
mod_carot <- lmer(Thickness_shell ~ Carot_ugyolk +Length_egg + (1|NestID), data=shell3) 
plot(mod_carot)
summary(mod_carot)
anova(mod_carot)

```
Conclusion: Controlling for egg length, there is not relationship between carotenoids and eggshell thickness. 

If we control for volume....
```{r}
mod_carot <- lmer(Thickness_shell ~ Carot_ugyolk + Volume_egg + (1|NestID), data=shell) #Don't need random effect
plot(mod_carot)
summary(mod_carot)
anova(mod_carot)


mod_carot <- lmer(Thickness_shell ~ Carot_ugyolk + Volume_egg + (1|NestID), data=shell2) #Don't need random effect


```

Conclusion: Yolk carotenoids are not associated with eggshell thickness when controlling for volume. Excluding PE24 doesn't make a difference. 

##8 Eggshell thickness repeatability
##8.1 Load repeatability data
```{r}
val <- read.csv("Shell thickness validation.csv") %>% arrange(Egg)
```
##8.2 Calculate repeatability
```{r}
rpt1 <- rpt(Thickness ~ (1 | Egg), grname = "Egg", data = val, datatype="Gaussian",
    nboot = 1000, npermut = 0)
rpt1

```
